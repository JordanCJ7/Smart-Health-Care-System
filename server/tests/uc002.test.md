## UC-002: Patient Appointment & Registration Tests

This test suite validates the complete patient appointment booking and registration workflow from slot discovery to confirmation.

### What's Tested

#### ✅ **Main Workflow (Happy Path)**
1. **View Available Slots (Step 2-3)**
   - Patients can search available slots by specialization
   - Returns doctor information and time slots
   - Public endpoint (no authentication required)

2. **Hold Slot Temporarily (Step 4)**
   - Patient can hold a slot for limited time (default 10 minutes)
   - Prevents double-booking during payment
   - Slot marked as 'Held' with expiration

3. **Book Appointment with Payment (Step 5-6)**
   - Patient books appointment with validated payment
   - Atomic transaction: appointment + schedule update
   - Payment completion verified before booking

4. **Schedule Updated Atomically (Step 6)**
   - Doctor schedule automatically updated
   - Slot status changes from 'Available' → 'Booked'
   - Appointment linked to schedule slot

5. **View Appointments (Step 8)**
   - Patients can view their own appointments
   - Doctors can view their appointments
   - Staff/Admin can view all appointments

6. **Confirmation Notification (Step 7)**
   - In-app notification sent to patient
   - Includes appointment details
   - ICS calendar file generated

7. **ICS Calendar File Generated (Step 7)**
   - VCALENDAR format with event details
   - Includes reminder alarm (1 hour before)
   - Compatible with Outlook, Google Calendar, Apple Calendar

#### ✅ **Extensions & Error Handling**

8. **Concurrency Conflict Detection (Extension 6a)**
   - Two users cannot book same slot
   - Returns HTTP 409 (Conflict) status
   - Error message guides user to select another slot

9. **Waitlist When No Slots (Extension 3a)**
   - Patient can add to waitlist
   - Specify preferred and alternative dates
   - Staff can notify when slots open

10. **Payment Validation (Step 5)**
    - Invalid payment IDs rejected
    - Only completed payments accepted
    - Payment must belong to requesting user

11. **Authentication Required (Step 1)**
    - All booking endpoints require JWT token
    - 401 Unauthorized for missing token
    - Token must be valid and not expired

12. **Input Validation**
    - Invalid doctor IDs rejected
    - Missing required fields rejected
    - Type validation on all inputs

13. **Slot Hold Release**
    - Held slots can be manually released
    - Automatic release via background job
    - Prevents stale holds blocking availability

14. **Waitlist Management**
    - Patient can view waitlist entries
    - Patient can cancel waitlist entries
    - Staff can notify waitlist patients

15. **Role-Based Access**
    - Staff can view all appointments
    - Patients limited to own appointments
    - Admin has full access

16. **Appointment Status Updates**
    - Doctors can complete appointments
    - Status updates tracked
    - Notes can be added

17. **Filtering and Queries**
    - Filter appointments by date
    - Filter by status, doctor, patient
    - Efficient query performance

## Test Structure

```javascript
beforeAll()                    // Setup (runs once)
  ├─ Clean database
  ├─ Create doctor (Staff with specialization)
  ├─ Create patient
  ├─ Create admin
  ├─ Login all users (get JWT tokens)

  └─ Create completed payment

test 1-7                       // Main workflow + concurrency
test 8-9                       // Waitlist functionality
test 10-12                     // Validation & auth errors
test 13-14                     // Slot hold & waitlist cancel
test 15-17                     // Role-based access & filtering

## Key Assertions

### Data Structure Validation
```javascript
expect(response.body.data).toBeDefined()
expect(response.body.data.availableSlots).toBeInstanceOf(Array)
expect(appointment.status).toBe('Scheduled')
```

### Business Logic Validation
```javascript
expect(bookedSlot.status).toBe('Booked')
expect(heldSlot.heldUntil).toBeDefined()
expect(response.body.data.icsFile).toContain('BEGIN:VCALENDAR')
```

### Error Handling Validation
```javascript
expect(response.status).toBe(409)  // Conflict
expect(response.body.success).toBe(false)
expect(response.body.error).toContain('already taken')
```

### Authorization Validation
```javascript
expect(response.status).toBe(401)  // Unauthorized
expect(response.status).toBe(403)  // Forbidden
```

## Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: "MongoDB Connection Failed"
**Solution**: Ensure MongoDB is running
```bash
# Windows
net start MongoDB

# macOS/Linux
sudo systemctl start mongod
```

### Issue: "Slot already booked" on first run
**Solution**: Database not cleaned properly
```bash
# Drop test database
mongo
use smarthealthcare
db.dropDatabase()
```

### Issue: "Payment validation failed"
**Cause**: Payment not found or wrong status
**Check**: Ensure payment is created in `beforeAll()` with status 'Completed'

### Issue: "Tests taking too long"
**Cause**: MongoDB queries slow or connection issues
**Solution**: 
- Use local MongoDB instance
- Ensure indexes are created
- Increase timeout: `jest.setTimeout(30000)`

### Issue: "Concurrent test fails intermittently"
**Cause**: Timing issues with slot holds
**Solution**: Ensure proper test isolation and cleanup
