## UC-004: Nurse Triage and Admission Workflow Tests

This test suite validates the complete nurse triage and admission workflow from patient verification to bed assignment with doctor notification.

### What's Tested

#### âœ… **Main Workflow (Happy Path)**
1. **Nurse Verifies Patient Identity (Step 2)**
   - Staff member (nurse) can verify patient by digital health card
   - System retrieves complete patient details
   - Validates patient exists in system

2. **Nurse Accesses Patient Medical History (Step 3)**
   - Nurse retrieves patient's medical records
   - Includes appointments, triage history, lab orders, prescriptions
   - Read-only access to comprehensive patient data

3. **Nurse Creates Triage Record (Step 4)**
   - Records vital signs (BP, HR, temp, respiratory rate, O2 saturation)
   - Documents symptoms and observations
   - Assigns severity level (Critical, Urgent, Stable, Normal)
   - Status automatically set to "Queued"

4. **Nurse Checks Bed Availability (Step 5)**
   - Lists all beds with current status
   - Filters vacant beds for assignment
   - Shows ward and bed number details

5. **Nurse Assigns Bed to Patient (Steps 5 & 8)**
   - Assigns available bed to patient
   - Updates triage record with bed assignment
   - Changes admission status to "Admitted-ER"
   - Automatically notifies assigned doctor

6. **System Generates Audit Logs (Step 6)**
   - Logs all triage actions automatically
   - Records user, action, resource, timestamp
   - Tracks success/failure status
   - Includes IP address and user agent

7. **Priority Queue Sorting (Step 7)**
   - Sorts patients by severity level first
   - Within same severity, sorts by arrival time (FIFO)
   - Critical â†’ Urgent â†’ Stable â†’ Normal priority order

8. **Doctor Receives Notification (Step 8)**
   - Doctor gets high-priority notification
   - Includes patient name, bed number, ward
   - Notification type: PATIENT_ADMITTED
   - Status starts as "Unread"

#### âœ… **Error Handling & Extensions**
9. **Extension 2a: Missing Patient Details**
   - Handles invalid digital health card ID
   - Returns 404 with appropriate error message
   - Suggests contacting support

10. **Extension 5a: No Beds Available**
    - Prevents assignment to occupied beds
    - Returns 400 with clear error message
    - Indicates patient should be added to waiting list

11. **Authorization Control**
    - Patients **cannot** create triage records (403 Forbidden)
    - Only Staff (nurses/doctors) can manage triage

12. **Authentication Required**
    - All endpoints require valid JWT token (401 Unauthorized)
    - No anonymous access allowed

13. **Data Validation**
    - Missing required fields rejected (400 Bad Request)
    - Invalid data formats rejected
    - Validates severity levels and vital signs

14. **Complete Workflow Integration**
    - End-to-end test from verification to admission
    - Validates all steps work together
    - Confirms audit logs and notifications

## Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: "MongoDB Connection Failed"
**Solution**: Make sure MongoDB is running
```bash
# Check MongoDB status
# Start MongoDB service if needed
```

### Issue: "Jest did not exit"
**Solution**: Use `--forceExit` flag
```bash
npm test -- tests/uc004.test.js --forceExit
```

### Issue: "Tests taking too long"
**Solution**: Tests run in ~15 seconds, optimized for speed
```bash
npm test -- tests/uc004.test.js
```

### Issue: "401 Unauthorized errors"
**Cause**: Token extraction issue
**Check**: Login response returns `data.token` not just `token`

### Issue: "Audit logs not found"
**Cause**: Async timing issue
**Solution**: Tests use `await` and direct database queries

## Audit Log Actions Verified

- âœ… `CREATE_TRIAGE` - When triage record created
- âœ… `ASSIGN_BED` - When bed assigned to patient
- âœ… `VIEW_PATIENT_HISTORY` - When medical history accessed
- âœ… Includes user ID, role, resource, timestamp
- âœ… Tracks success/failure status
- âœ… Non-blocking (doesn't fail main operations)

---

## Notification System Verified

- âœ… Type: `PATIENT_ADMITTED`
- âœ… Priority: `High`
- âœ… Recipient: Doctor ID
- âœ… Sender: Nurse ID
- âœ… Status: `Unread` initially
- âœ… Includes patient details, bed info, ward

---

## Priority Queue Algorithm

### Severity Levels (in priority order)
1. **Critical** - Priority value: 1
2. **Urgent** - Priority value: 2
3. **Stable** - Priority value: 3
4. **Normal** - Priority value: 4

### Sorting Logic
```javascript
1. Sort by severity priority (lower number = higher priority)
2. If same severity, sort by createdAt timestamp (FIFO)
```

### Test Validation
- Critical patient appears first
- Normal patient appears last
- Verified using array index comparison
